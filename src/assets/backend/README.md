# Dummy Backend Payloads

This directory contains sample JSON files that represent the expected payloads for various API endpoints in the CMS backend.

These files serve as a "data contract" for the Angular frontend, allowing for development and testing without needing a live backend server. They demonstrate the expected structure for:

-   User authentication (`login-response.json`)
-   User profiles (`profile-response.json`)
-   Lists of users (`users-list-response.json`)
-   Lists of content (`content-list-response.json`)

These are for demonstration and development purposes only.
